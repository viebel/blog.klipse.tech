  review: Yehonathan loves to teach and share his vast knowledge with others. Every code review with him is a lesson in elegant programming and enrichment. I am happy to consult with him both on programming and about decisions in my professional life.

  review: Yehonathan's Clojure workshop has been a blast! I've been using Python for 2 years before the workshop and getting used to Clojure wasn't that intuitive for me at the beginning. Thanks to the course I've been able to learn a constructed and step-by-step way to improve my technical skills and my way of thinking. Since the workshop, I have been much more comfortable using Clojure and functional programming. Now, I know how to write code that manipulates data without using loops all the time. Moreover, my code is much cleaner, much shorter and it's easier for me to understand my peers' code.

  review:  Learning with Yehonathan is way far from just improving your coding skills. It makes you rethink your decisions, helps you arrange guidelines before even touching your keyboard. I really recommend his services, you will find him very friendly and smiling at the same time he criticises your code.

  review: What is remarkable with Yehonathan is that he strives to make his vast knowledge accessible to less experienced developers. He prefers to listen first instead of lecturing, making his advice more adapted to the situation at hand. His pedagogy sets him apart from other mentors that are not conveying their ideas as clearly as Yehonathan does.

  review: There's something incredibly motivating about Yehonathan! The interview with him made me love Clojure and anything related to it! It's so amazing to know that I'll become a true professional by learning from a true professional! As excited as I am about our field I was never this excited!

  review: Each time I advise with Yehonatan for code review, I hear something I did not think of. Something that is usually simple and elegant. Yehonathan also has the ability to explain complex tech topics in a simple way. Yehonathan's passion for teaching technology makes me feel smart.
