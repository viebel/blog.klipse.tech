  review: Yehonathan is a treasure. Bringing him as a coding mentor to my team has been one of my best management decisions. It has saved us months of frustration and boosted team performance and satisfaction.

  review: What is remarkable with Yehonathan is that he strives to make his vast knowledge accessible to less experienced developers. I often felt after having a talk with him that I understood a subject much deeper than when I read articles on the internet. He prefers to listen first instead of lecturing, making his advice more adapted to the situation at hand. His pedagogy is setting him apart from other IT mentors that are not conveying their ideas as clearly as Yehonathan does. Furthermore, he is very agreeable and easy to work with.

  review: There's something incredibly motivating about Yehonathan! The interview with him made me love Clojure and anything related to it! It's so amazing to know that I'll become a true professional by learning from a true professional! As excited as I am about our field I was never this excited!
