## The tokenizer

 We're gonna start off with our first phase of parsing, lexical analysis, with
 the tokenizer.

 We're just going to take our string of code and break it down into an array
 of tokens.

  `(add 2 (subtract 4 2))` should become  `[{ type: 'paren', value: '(' }, ...]`


We start by accepting an input string of code, and we're gonna set up two things...


~~~eval-js
tokenizeParen = (input, current) => {
  // We're also going to store the `current` character in the `input`.
    let char = input[current];
      // The first thing we want to check for is an open parenthesis. This will
        // later be used for `CallExpression` but for now we only care about the
	  // character.
	    // We check to see if we have an open parenthesis:
	      if (char === '(') {
	          // If we do, we push a new token with the type `paren` and set the value
		      // to an open parenthesis.
		          return [{
			        type: 'paren',
				      value: '(',
				          }, current + 1];

  }
    return [null, current];
    }
~~~

~~~eval-js
tokenizeParen('(foo 1 2 3)', 0)
~~~

~~~eval-js
function tokenizer(input) {
  // A `current` variable for tracking our position in the code like a cursor.
    let current = 0;
      // And a `tokens` array for pushing our tokens to.
        let tokens = [];
	  // We start by creating a `while` loop where we are setting up our `current`
	    // variable to be incremented as much as we want `inside` the loop.
	      //
	        // We do this because we may want to increment `current` many times within a
		  // single loop because our tokens can be any length.
		    while (current < input.length) {
		        // We're also going to store the `current` character in the `input`.
			    let char = input[current];
			        let token = null;
				    [token, current] = tokenizeParen(input, current);
				        if (token) {
					      tokens.push(token);
					            continue;
						        }
							    // Next we're going to check for a closing parenthesis. We do the same exact
							        // thing as before: Check for a closing parenthesis, add a new token,
								    // increment `current`, and `continue`.
								        if (char === ')') {
									      tokens.push({
									              type: 'paren',
										              value: ')',
											            });
												          current++;
													        continue;
														    }
														        // Moving on, we're now going to check for whitespace. This is interesting
															    // because we care that whitespace exists to separate characters, but it
															        // isn't actually important for us to store as a token. We would only throw
																    // it out later.
																        // So here we're just going to test for existence and if it does exist we're
																	    // going to just `continue` on.
																	        let WHITESPACE = /\s/;
																		    if (WHITESPACE.test(char)) {
																		          current++;
																			        continue;
																				    }
																				        // The next type of token is a number. This is different than what we have
																					    // seen before because a number could be any number of characters and we
																					        // want to capture the entire sequence of characters as one token.
																						    //
																						        //   (add 123 456)
																							    //        ^^^ ^^^
																							        //        Only two separate tokens
																								    //
																								        // So we start this off when we encounter the first number in a sequence.

																											          let value = '';
																												        // Then we're going to loop through each character in the sequence until
																													      // we encounter a character that is not a number, pushing each character
																													            // that is a number to our `value` and incrementing `current` as we go.
																														          while (NUMBERS.test(char)) {
																															          value += char;
																																          char = input[++current];
																																	        }
																																		      // After that we push our `number` token to the `tokens` array.
																																		            tokens.push({ type: 'number', value });

	        let value = '';
		      // We'll skip the opening double quote in our token.
		            char = input[++current];
			          // Then we'll iterate through each character until we reach another
				        // double quote.
					      while (char !== '"') {
        value += char;
        char = input[++current];
      }
      // Skip the closing double quote.
      char = input[++current];
      // And add our `string` token to the `tokens` array.
      tokens.push({ type: 'string', value });
      continue;
    }
    // The last type of token will be a `name` token. This is a sequence of
    // letters instead of numbers, that are the names of functions in our lisp
    // syntax.
    //
    //   (add 2 4)
    //    ^^^
    //    Name token
    let LETTERS = /[a-z]/i;
    if (LETTERS.test(char)) {
      let value = '';
      // Again we're just going to loop through all the letters pushing them to
      // a value.
      while (LETTERS.test(char)) {
        value += char;
        char = input[++current];
      }
      // And pushing that value as a token with the type `name` and continuing.
      tokens.push({ type: 'name', value });
      continue;
    }
    // Finally if we have not matched a character by now, we're going to throw
    // an error and completely exit.
    throw new TypeError('I dont know what this character is: ' + char);

  // Then at the end of our `tokenizer` we simply return the tokens array.

Let's see our tokenizer in action:

~~~eval-js
tokenizer("(add 2 (subtract 4 2))")
