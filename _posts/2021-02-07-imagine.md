Here is an adaptation of *Imagine*, by John Lennon to the context of **Data-Oriented programming**.

Imagine there's no *objects* 

It's easy if you try

No *classes* below us

Above us only *information*

Imagine all the entities being only *data*

<br>

Imagine there's no *mutation*

It isn't hard to do

Nothing to protect with a *mutex*

And no *deadlock* too

Imagine all the entities being only *data*

<br> 

You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day *OO* will join us

And the world will be as one

<br>


Imagine no *code* is *locked*

I wonder if you can

No need for *methods* and *inheritance*

A brotherhood of input and output

Imagine all the code being *pure functions*

<br>


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one

I hope some day *OO* will join us

And the world will be as one
