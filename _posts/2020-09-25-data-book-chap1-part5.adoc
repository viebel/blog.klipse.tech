A couple of years ago, a famous composer had an illumination and he wrote a song about a world without OO.

Imagine there's no objects +
It's easy if you try +
No classes below us +
Above us only information +
Imagine all the entities being only data +

Imagine there's no mutations +
It isn't hard to do +
Nothing to protect with a mutex +
And no deadlock too +
Imagine all the entities being only data +

You may say I'm a dreamer +
But I'm not the only one +
I hope some day OO will join us +
And the world will be as one +

Imagine no code is locked +
I wonder if you can +
No need for methods and inheritance +
A brotherhood of input and output +
Imagine all the code being pure functions +

You may say I'm a dreamer +
But I'm not the only one +
I hope some day OO will join us +
And the world will be as one +
