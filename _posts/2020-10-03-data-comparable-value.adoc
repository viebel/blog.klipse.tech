In Data Oriented programming data is a first class citizen that is considered as a value.

It comes down to 3 principles:

. link:{% post_url 2020-10-02-immutable-data %}[Principle #3: Data is immutable]
. link:{% post_url 2020-10-03-data-comparable-value %}[Principle #4: Data is comparable by value]
. link:{% post_url 2020-10-03-data-literal %}[Principle #5: Data has a literal representation]


In this article, we explore Principle #4.


== The principle in a nutshell

[quote]
Principle #4: Data collections are considered to be equal if they represent the same collection of values.


== Remarks on Principle #4

* Definition of equality in Computer Science is a deep topic. We are only scratching the surface here
* We are not dealing here with the comparison of data collection of different types (e.g. lists and vectors)
* We are not dealing only with equality of primitive types

== Illustration of Principle #4

In concrete terms, Principle #4 says that:

. Two arrays with same elements are considered to be equal
. Two maps with the same keys and values are considered to be equal


This definition is in fact a recursive definition because the elements of an array and the values of a map could themselves be arrays and maps.


In native JavaScript, this principle is broken both for arrays and maps:

[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var a = [1];
var b = [1];
a === b;
----
[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var a = {username: "foo"};
var b = {username: "foo"};
a === b;
----

In order to compare data by value, one needs a custom equality function like the `is` function provided by
  https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js[Immutable.js]

[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var a = Immutable.List([1]);
var b = Immutable.List([1]);
Immutable.is(a, b);
----
[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var a = Immutable.Map({username: "foo"});
var b = Immutable.Map({username: "foo"});
Immutable.is(a, b);
----


==  Benefits of Principle #4

When we compare data by value across the board, our programs benefit from:

* Writing unit tests is a pleasure
* Maps with data keys


=== Benefit #1: Writing unit tests is a pleasure


When data equality is defined by value, we can specify the expected return value of a function as data instead of having to check each value separately.


Let's write a "unit test" for a function that returns a (immutable) map with the full name of an author

Here is the code for `addFullName`, using the `set` function from Immutable.js as we showed in link:{% post_url 2020-10-02-immutable-data %}[Principle #3: Data is immutable].

[source, klipse-javascript]
----
function addFullName(data) {
  return data.set("fullName",
                  data.get('firstName') + " " + data.get('lastName'));
}
----


In order to write a unit test for `addFullName` without equality by value, we would need to check each field separately:

[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var isaac = Immutable.Map({firstName: "Isaac", lastName: "Asimov"});
var enrichedIsaac = addFullName(isaac);
enrichedIsaac.get("firstName") === "Isaac" &&
  enrichedIsaac.get("lastName") === "Asimov" &&
  enrichedIsaac.get("fullName") === "Isaac Asimov";

----

With equality by value, using `Immutable.is` from Immutable.js, the unit test becomes much clearer
as we are able to simply specify what is the expected output of our function:

[source, klipse-javascript]
----
var isaac = Immutable.Map({firstName: "Isaac", lastName: "Asimov"});
var enrichedIsaac = addFullName(isaac);
Immutable.is(enrichedIsaac, Immutable.Map({firstName: "Isaac",
                                           lastName: "Asimov",
                                           fullName: "Isaac Asimov"}))
----


=== Benefit #2: Maps with data keys


The behavior of a map data structure is connected deeply with the definition of *equality* of the map keys. When we look for the value associated to key `a` in a map `m` what we really means is to find an entry in the map whose key is *equal* to `a`.

In many situations, the keys of the maps are strings and strings are compared by value. But what happens when we allow keys to be maps?

In JavaScript, when map keys are maps, we could have two different entries in the map with the "same" key:

[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var myMap = new Map;
var myData = {"foo": 1};
var yourData = {"foo": 1};

myMap.set(myData, 42);
myMap.set(yourData, 43);
----

The reason is that JavaScript doesn't adhere to Principle #4.


When we use a library that adheres to Principle #4, like Immutable.js, this weird situation doesn't occur:

[source,klipse-javascript]
----
var myMap = Immutable.Map({});
var myData = Immutable.Map({"foo": 1});
var yourData = Immutable.Map({"foo": 1});

myMap.set(myData, 42);
myMap.set(yourData, 43);
----



== Price for Principle #4

There are no free meals. Applying Principle #4 comes at a price:

* No native support


=== Price #1: No native support

In Clojure, equality is defined by value in compliance with Principle #4.
However, on most programming languages, equality is defined by reference and not by value.

In order to adhere to Principle #4, we must careful to never use the native equality check to compare data collections.

== Wrapping up


DO considers data as a value. As consequence, data should be compared by value either when we explicitly check if two pieces of data are equal or implicitly as a data key in a map. In most languages, we need a third party library to provide this value based equality check.
