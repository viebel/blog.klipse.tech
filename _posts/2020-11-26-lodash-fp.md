Did you know that [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - the popular JavaScript utility library - had a **functional** flavor?


The most exciting part to me is that functions of Lodash FP do not **mutate** the data they receive.

As a Clojure developer, I am excited because I am **addicted** to **data immutability**.

# TL;DR

Lodash FP differs from the standard Lodash on 4 main points:

1. The functions receive the **data** to be manipulated as **last argument**
1. The functions **do not mutate** the data they manipulate
1. The functions are **auto curried**
1. The functions receive the **iteratee** as **first argument**

# Immutability


In Lodash FP, the functions do not **mutate** the data they manipulate.

For instance, the `set()` function differs from the standard Lodash in two points:

1. It receives the object as **last argument** 
1. It returns a **new version** of the object instead of modifying the object

In the following code snippet, you see that `a` is not modified by `fp.set()`:

~~~eval-js
var a = {foo: 1};
var b = fp.set("foo", 2, a);
[a, b]
~~~

However in standard Lodash, `a` is modified by `_.set()`:

~~~eval-js
var a = {foo: 1};
var b = _.set(a, "foo", 2);
[a, b]
~~~


The [implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65055922/how-do-immutable-methods-work-in-lodash-fp/65059704#65059704) of the data immutability is based on **structural sharing**, which makes it efficient both in terms of memory and CPU.


# Auto currying

In Lodash FP, the functions that receive an **iteratee** (a piece of code that expresses the data manipulation) receive the iteratee as **first argument** and are **curried**. 


Functions like `map()` receive a single argument (the iteratee) and return a function to be called on a collection:

~~~eval-js
fp.map(x => x +1)([1, 2, 3])
~~~

Functions like `reduce()` function receive two arguments (the iteratee and the accumulator) and return a function to be called on a collection:

~~~eval-js
fp.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)([1, 2, 3])
~~~


# Configuration

If you want to benefit from the immutability without changing the argument order, you can configure it:

~~~eval-js
// Every option is `true` by default.
var _fp = fp.convert({
  // Specify capping iteratee arguments.
  'cap': false,
  // Specify currying.
  'curry': false,
  // Specify fixed arity.
  'fixed': false,
  // Specify immutable operations.
  'immutable': true,
  // Specify rearranging arguments.
  'rearg': false
});
~~~

Now, Lodash FP looks like regular Lodash, excepts it doesn't mutate data: 

~~~eval-js
var a = {foo: 1};
var b = _fp.set(a, "foo", 2);
[a, b]
~~~

# Installation

The installation instruction and the semantics of the functional flavor are exposed in [Lodash FP Guide](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
