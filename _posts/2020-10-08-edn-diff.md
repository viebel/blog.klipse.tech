Compare recursively two Clojure data structures `a` and `b`.

Comparison is updated as you type...

<pre class="hidden"><code class="language-klipse">
(require '[clojure.data :refer [diff]])
</code></pre>

~~~klipse
(def a {:only-in-a 1
        :both-in-a-and-b 3}) 
~~~

~~~klipse
(def b {:only-in-b 2
        :both-in-a-and-b 3}) 
~~~

Full comparison:
~~~klipse
(def full-comparison (clojure.data/diff a b)) 
~~~


Things only in `a`:

~~~klipse
(first full-comparison)
~~~

Things only in `b`:

~~~klipse
(second full-comparison)
~~~

Things in both `a` and `b`:

~~~klipse
(last full-comparison)
~~~

Comparison rules:

* For equal `a` and `b`, return `[nil nil a]`.
* Maps are subdiffed where keys match and values differ.
* Sets are never subdiffed.
* All sequential things are treated as associative collections by their indexes, with results returned as vectors.
* Everything else (including strings!) is treated as an atom and compared for equality.
