== Before we start
. link:{% post_url 2020-09-25-data-book-chap0 %}[What is Data Oriented Programming]

== Part 1: Design a Data Oriented system
. link:{% post_url 2020-09-21-data-book-chap1-part1 %}[The tendency to complexity of Object Oriented programming]
. link:{% post_url 2020-09-27-do-principles %}[Principles of Data Oriented programming]
. Decrease complexity by separating Code from Data
. Gain power by representing data records as maps
. link:{% post_url 2020-12-18-occ-do-git %}[Maintain effectiveness by managing state with immutable data]


== Part 2: Implement a Data Oriented system
. State management in an immutable world
. Data manipulation kills bugs in the egg
. The data manipulation tool set in action
. Write unit tests without mocking
. Debug your program without a debugger

== Part 3: Evolve a Data Oriented system
. Write your own data manipulation tool set
. Extend the primitive data types
. Specify the shape of your data
. Write unit tests that cover every possible data combination with property based testing

Are you now motivated to discover the DO world?
