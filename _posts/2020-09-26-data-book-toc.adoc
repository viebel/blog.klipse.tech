= Before we start
. link:{% post_url 2020-09-25-data-book-chap0 %}[What is Data Oriented Programming]

= Part 1: Design a Data Oriented system
. link:{% post_url 2020-09-21-data-book-chap1-part1 %}[The complexity of Object Oriented programming]
. The simplicity of Data Oriented programming
. Model business entities as data collections
. Polymorphism without objects
. Data as a value that never changes
. Assess the quality of your data model

= Part 2: Implement a Data Oriented system
. State management in an immutable world
. Data manipulation kills bugs in the egg
. The data manipulation tool set in action
. Write unit tests without mocking
. Debug your program without a debugger

= Part 3: Evolve a Data Oriented system
. Write your own data manipulation tool set
. Extend the primitive data types
. Specify the shape of your data
. Write unit tests that cover every possible data combination with property based testing

Are you now motivated to discover the DO world?
