# ClojureX 2016

I'm so excited to join Clojure Exchange 2016 as a speaker - where I will share my insights on Code Interactivity Everywhere with [KLIPSE](https://github.com/viebel/klipse).

# KLIPSE - The background

My original intention with KLIPSE - was to provide to myself a convenient way to see the `javascript` code produced by the `clojurescript` compiler. This intention stated to emerge in my mind after reading David Nolen's blog post [ClojureScript can compile itself](http://swannodette.github.io/2015/07/29/clojurescript-17) on July 29, 2015. It became more concrete after watching Maria Geller's talk [The ClojureScript Compiler - A Look Behind the Curtains](https://youtu.be/Elg17s_nwDg) somewhere in November 2015.

Everybody around me was skeptic regarding the value of such a project. They were telling me:

> What's the problem? You simply need to create a `clojurescript` project edit a file, let the compiler does its job and open the `js` file in your IDE.


But I was not convinced by their skepticism. Afterwards, I realized that I was seeking for 3 important things:

- **Interactivity**: I wanted to be able to edit code an see the transpiled `javascript` immediatly - as I type my code.
- **Reach**: I wanted to be able to see transpiled `javascript` everywhere - in the bus, while walking, while running. I didn't want to see it only when my dev environment is set up.
- **Simplicity**: I wanted a simple solution - something that works in a simple way


Since the begining of 2016, I have been spending my nights on building `KLIPSE` - around those 3 guiding principles.


# KLIPSE - the WEB REPL

After playing a bit with `eval-str` and `compile-str` from `cljs.js` namespaces, I came up building this [WEB REPL](http://app.klipse.tech) that evaluates `clojure` expressions and displays the `transpiled` javascript:

<iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300px"
    src= 
"http://app.klipse.tech/?cljs_in=(println%20%22Hello%20ClojureX%22)%0A(map%20inc%20%5B1%202%203%5D)">
</iframe>


I was so excited by the simplicity of this WEB REPL that I decided to create a blog named [blog.klipse.tech](http://blog.klipse.tech) in order to explore and share deep features of the language. The uniqueness of the blog would be that all the code snippets will be interactive.


During this period, I wrote about [static vs dynamic dispathch]({% post_url 2016-04-15-static-fns %}), [deftype and defrecord]({% post_url 2016-04-26-deftype-explained %}), [truth in clojurescript]({% post_url 2016-04-02-truth-in-cljs%}), [defprotocol's secret]({% post_url 2016-04-09-clojurescript-protocols-secret %}), [IFn magic]({% post_url 2016-04-11-extend-ifn %}), [how not to write macros]({% post_url 2016-05-04-macro-tutorial-2%}), [syntax quote]({% post_url 2016-05-05-macro-tutorial-3 %}) and more...

I learned a lot of deep stuff about `clojure` and `clojurescript` through the necessity of providing working code snippets to my readers. It required me to make sure I fully understand what I'm blogging about.


But still something was missing: it was not so convenient to embed isolated iframes inside a blog post.

This is how I came to the second facet of KLIPSE: the plugin.

# KLIPSE - the plugin

The [KLIPSE plugin](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) is a `javascript` tag embeddable in any html page: the only thing you need to do is to put your code snippets into a `div` (Ar any other html tag). And BOOM your code snippets become interactive: your readers can edit the code and see the evaluation result as they type.

You get interactive code snippets like this:

~~~klipse
(map inc [1 2 3])
~~~

Variables are share among the snippets:

~~~klipse
(def a-number 42)
~~~

~~~klipse
(map inc [1 a-number 3])
~~~

And you can also transpile `clojurescript` into `javascript`:

~~~klipse-js
(let [[a b] #js [1 2]]
  a)
~~~

# What else?

There a a lot of additional features in [KLIPSE][klipse-url]:

- Using external libraries
- Interactive Code Snippets from github gist
- Other languages: ruby, javascript, python, scheme
- [Slides with klipse](https://github.com/viebel/slides.klipse.tech/)
- Interactive Documentation with [codox and klipse](https://github.com/viebel/codox-klipse-theme)


I invite you to join me in London at Clojure Exchange in December 1, 2016  where I will show more fun stuff that you can do with [KLIPSE](https://github.com/viebel/klipse).
